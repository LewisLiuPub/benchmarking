# Latency tests
This directory contains latency results obtained by running the latency test tools that each implementation vendor provides.  The experiments are performed both in a [local host configuration](localhost) (the publisher and the subscriber run in the same machine), and in [dual host configuration](dualhost) (the publisher and the subscriber) run in separate machines connected to a local network via ethernet. To replicate the results exposed here, look at [local host experiments log](localhost/experiments_log.md) and [dual host experiments log](dualhost/experiments_log.md)
