### Software versions
* Fast-RTPS commit: 0bcafbde1c6fa3ef7285819980f932df910dba61
* CycloneDDS commit: aa5236dea46b82e6db26a0c87b90cedeca465524
* OpenSplice version: v6.9

### Software patches
* In CycloneDDS throughput test, the user specifies a payload size for the message. However, the total size of every message is a combination of a sequence number, the message number, and that payload, which results in 8 bytes more than what the user specified. To have a message of the actual user size (including data, message number, and sequence number), [cyclonedds_throughput_publisher.patch](../patches/cyclonedds_throughput_publisher.patch) is applied to `publisher.c`. This patch also disables the batching feature, since this would queue messages and group them until they filled a UDP datagram (point at where they are sent), which is a different behaviour than what is expected of a throughput test.
* To display the message size after applying the previous patch, [cyclonedds_throughput_subscriber.patch](../patches/cyclonedds_throughput_subscriber.patch) is applied to `subscriber.c`.
* [opensplice_throughput_implementation.patch](../patches/opensplice_throughput_implementation.patch) patches OpenSplice's `implementation.cpp` to adjust the message size in the same manner as for CycloneDDS.
* To set the appropriate reliability to OpenSpice's `Throughput` example, [opensplice_throughput_entities.patch](../patches/opensplice_throughput_entities.patch) is applied to entities.cpp
