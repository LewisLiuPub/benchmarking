### Software versions
* Fast-RTPS commit: b5ae9e9c9ea7ce49c64c0ef3f6c96a3dc563b16f (v1.9.3) with a cherry-pick of 24f462d9b8ebbe82e5180f9e8788c1547a65bfb6, which enables intra-process latency testing for Fast-RTPS.
* CycloneDDS commit: 9e61bff9b9df564338a0d8c57442c372668719c0.
* A [*RoundtripIntraprocess* application](#cyclonedds-roundtripintraprocess) that enables the testing of CycloneDDS' intra-process feature by running publisher and subscriber in the same process has been created.

### Run the experiments
##### Fast-RTPS
Fast-RTPS' latency test is configured using [latency_intraprocess.xml](fastrtps/2019-11-15_11-57-32/latency_intraprocess.xml). The test is executed with one command.

```bash
${PATH_TO_BUILD_DIR}/LatencyTest both --samples 10000 --xml latency_intraprocess.xml --export_raw_data measurements.csv
```
##### CycloneDDS
*RoundtripIntraprocess* is run for a specific payload, generating a CSV file with all the measurements taken. To run the application for several payloads, the following `Bash` script can be used.
```bash
for payload in 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384;
do
    ${PATH_TO_BUILD_DIR}/RoundtripIntraprocess ${payload} 10000 0 measurements_${payload}.csv
done
```

## CycloneDDS' *RoundtripIntraprocess*
The C code for the *RoundtripIntraprocess* application can be found in [ping_pong.c](cyclonedds/roundtrip_intraprocess/ping_pong.c). To use this code, place it in CycloneDDS' `examples/roundtrip/` directory, and apply patches [CMakeLists.export.patch](cyclonedds/roundtrip_intraprocess/CMakeLists.export.patch) and [CMakeLists.txt.patch](cyclonedds/roundtrip_intraprocess/CMakeLists.txt.patch).
