# iRobot results
This directory contains the results of performing iRobot performance tests in different platforms:

Each platform's directory contains a log of the experiments performed, as well as the data collected for each of them.
Inside each platform, the experiments are identified by a time stamp.
The experiments' configuration and software versions are detail in the experiments log.

## Platforms
